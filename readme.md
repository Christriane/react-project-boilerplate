# Boilerplate Webpack React Project

A simple Webpack/React boilerplate setup to get a project up and running quickly. I built this while following Andrew Mead's React.js Udemy Course. This Includes a basic React.js, Auth setup and Heroku build setup.

## To Run Project
```
> git clone https://github.com/Christriane/webpack-react-project-boilerplate.git

> yarn
> yarn dev-server

```

## To Create Build files
